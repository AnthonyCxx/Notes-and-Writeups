# Dynamic Programming :D
- Bottom-up approach to problem solving
- Instance of problem divided into smaller instances
- Establish a recursive way to solve small problems


## Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)
- Hamiltonian Circle (a cycle that visits all points)
- Brute force is O(n-1)!
- Best solution is O(n²2^n)


Given a list of cities, and the distances between each pair of...

### O(n-1)! Solution

```C++

```

### O(n²2^n) Solution
