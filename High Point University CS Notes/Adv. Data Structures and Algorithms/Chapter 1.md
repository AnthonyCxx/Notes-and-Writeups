# Chapter 1
This is going to be beefy.

- _Non-decreasing Order_: an ordering in which the numbers do not necessarily increase, but never decrease. Basically increasing order but the number could be the same;
\[1, 1, 2, 3\] is non-decreasing order, but not increasing order since there is no increase between 1 and 1.
- _Parameter_: a variable in a problem that has not been assigned a specific value yet.
- _Algorithm_: Step by step procedure that produces an answer to a question.
- _Time Complexity Analysis_: How many times is the basic operation done for each value of the input size.
