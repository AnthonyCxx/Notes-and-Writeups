## Sorting Algorithms

### Selection Sort
- Time Complexity: O(n^2) <br />
[Selection sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/selection-sort/) iterates over the entire set and moves the smallest of a given subiteration to the end of the sorted section of
the list.

### Insertion Sort
- Time Complexity: O(n^2) <br />
[Insertion Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/insertion-sort/) makes a new set from the first element and ordinally inserts the other list's elements into the new set

### Bubble Sort
- Time Complexity: O(n^2) <br />
- [Bubble Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort/)
