# Greedy Algorithms

- Solve optimzation problems
- Does NOT divide into smaller sub-problems
- Obtain a solution by making a sequence of choices, each choice appears to be the best choice at that step
- Locally optimal
- Goal is to produce a globally optimal solution


- Selection Procedure: choose the next item to add to the solution set according to the greedy criterion satisfying the locally optimal consideration
- Feasability Check: determine 


## Spanning Tree
- Connected, weighted, undirected graph G
- Spanning tree is an acyclic sub-graph of G
