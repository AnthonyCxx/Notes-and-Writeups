# Computer Systems

## Computer Systems, Architecture and Organization
- _Architecture_: the attributes visible to the programmer (instruction sets, data representation, I/O mechanisms, addressing techniques).
- _Organization_: how the features are implemented on the hardware (control signals, interfaces, memory technology). Is multiplication implemented as just repeated addition? <br />

- CPUs of the same family (like the Intel x86 family) generally share the same basic architecture to allow for code compatibility (at least backwards). However, the actual 
CPU structure is different between versions.

## Structure and Functions
- _Structure_: the way in which components relate to each other.
- _Function_: the operation of individual components as part of the structure.

### Basic Functions
- Data processing: only a few fundamental types of processing (like adding numbers)
- Data storage: short-term and long-term
- Data movement: I/O
- Control: instructions

An example of the all functions in use together is adding numbers. Two numbers are loaded from the data storage facility by the control mechanism into the data processing
facility, where the data is added together. From there, the result is moved back into the data storage facility or into data movement (to be output).

## Operations

### Data Movement
Transferring data from one device or communication line (stream) to another. <br />
A good example of data movement is moving data from RAM into the CPU so it can be used in calculations.

### Storage
Data transferred from outside to storage, saving a word document.

### Processing from/to Storage
Like reading from/writing to the hard disk.

### Processing from Storage to I/O
