### Basic Functions
- Data processing: only a few fundamental types of processing (like adding numbers)
- Data storage: short-term and long-term
- Data movement: I/O
- Control: instructions

An example of the all functions in use together is adding numbers. Two numbers are loaded from the data storage facility by the control mechanism into the data processing
facility, where the data is added together. From there, the result is moved back into the data storage facility or into data movement (to be output).

## Operations

### Data Movement
Transferring data from one device or communication line (stream) to another. <br />
A good example of data movement is moving data from RAM into the CPU so it can be used in calculations.

### Storage
Data transferred from outside to storage, saving a word document.

### Processing from/to Storage
Like reading from/writing to the hard disk.

### Processing from Storage to I/O
Emailing a saved image...


# Computer Structure
The best way to understand a computer is the understand its components and then its subcompontents.

## CPU

### ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
Performs calculations

### Registers
Storage for the CPU so it can store data while it manipulates it. Registers are free to access (in terms of time), as opposed to accessing RAM which is expensive (taking a long 
time). Think of registers as the working set for the CPU. Accessing a register is like reaching over and grabbing a pencil at your desk, while accessing RAM is like having
to get up and go downstairs to get something and come all the way back.

### Interal CPU Interconnection

### Control Unit
Generates the electrical signals necessary to perform operations; basically, it sends commands.

## System Bus

## Memory

## Control Unit

### Sequencing Logic

### Control Unit Registers and Decoders
WHen you need to add two numbers like (a + b), 

### Control Memory
