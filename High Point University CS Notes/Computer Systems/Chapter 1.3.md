- The IAS machine used Von Neumann architecture, which stores both the program instructions and data in the same memory space.
- Used 40-bite words to store numbers (1 bit for a signed bit and 39 for the data). A total of (2^39) * 2 possible values. 20 for bits for instructions 8 bits for the operation
and 12 for addresses
