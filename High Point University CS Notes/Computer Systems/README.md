# Computer Systems

## Computer Systems, Architecture and Organization
- _Architecture_: the attributes visible to the programmer (instruction sets, data representation, I/O mechanisms, addressing techniques).
- _Organization_: how the features are implemented on the hardware (control signals, interfaces, memory technology). Is multiplication implemented as just repeated addition? <br />

CPUs of the same family (like the Intel x86 family) generally share the same basic architecture to allow for code compatibility (at least backwards).
