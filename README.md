# Study Guides

This repository contains study guides for various subjects that I make for myself and upload here to share with others. <br />
As I am a student as well, be sure to double-check the contents of a study guide before you use it. <br /> 
I am _not_ responsible for any discrepancies. <br />

## Guides
By 'complete' I mean as complete as I mean to make them.
