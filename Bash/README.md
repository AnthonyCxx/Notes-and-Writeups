# Notes: Bash Scripting
This is a collection of notes on Bash Scripting, which is primarily meant to be a reference rather than a learning resource. <br />
As per such, I do provide examples for reference, but do not explain them.

Note: **this project is in progress** and is continually being updated as a part of me learning Bash. I am still learning Bash.
