# Classes in C++
Classes are the heart of C++. A class is essentially a user-defined datatype that serves as a collection of data.
Classes are meant to mimic some concrete object or abstract idea. For example, a class 'Player' would contain a string for their name, an integer for their health, 
an integer for their attack damage and another integer to represent their level. These four variables together would allow us to create a single variable of type 'Player' 
that would have all of these properties. In addition to storing data, classes can have functions (called methods), which allow to class to perform actions. 
These actions don't have to affect other data outside the class; in fact, many methods are entirely internal. A class function (method) 'getLevel' could be as simple
as returning the method of the player.

### Format
```C++
class ClassName
{

};
```
> Notice the semi-colon at the end of the definition. <br />
> A class is a statement (in this case a description of a datatype) and so it needs a semi-colon.

### Example
