# Templates in C++
On the surface, templates are pretty simple; they're just a way to make a function generic/type-neutral, right? Well, no. C++'s templates are _far_ more powerful than
C# and Java's generics. Once you get really deep into it, you'll start exploring [recursive templates](http://www.oxfordalgorithmics.com/2014/10/06/c-template-recursion-and-specialisation/), [variadic templates](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2014/variadic-templates-in-c/), and [template metaprogramming](https://www.fluentcpp.com/2017/06/02/write-template-metaprogramming-expressively/). Templates are powerful, but also very hard to use since they require a foundational understanding of the language to implement properly and are infamous for causing repulsively long errors. Don't believe me? Mess up the direction of the arrows and run `cout >> x`; just see how many errors the template spawns.

Long story short: templates are powerful, but also very dangerous and many people are either starkly for or against templates.
