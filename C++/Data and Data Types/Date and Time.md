# Working with Date and Time in C++
Although C++ inherits [_\<ctime\>_](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/ctime/) from C, C++ provides its own library, [_\<chrono\>_](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/chrono/), with classes for date and time utilities. <br />
All classes from _\<chrono\>_ are a part of the namespace _std::chrono_.

# Measurements

## _duration_

### _duration_ typedefs
There are a set of instantiations of the _duration_ class to represent common units for time like seconds, minutes, and hours.
| Unit | Ratio |
| ---- | ----- |
| hours | 3600/1 |
| minutes |  |
| seconds |  |
| milliseconds |  |
| microseconds |  |
| nanoseconds |  |
