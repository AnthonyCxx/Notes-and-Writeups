# Working with Date and Time in C++
Just a heads up, this topic is especially hard. There is a lot to learn here — so much so that you could make a one hour tutorial about it.

Although C++ inherits [_\<ctime\>_]() from C, C++ provides its own library, [_\<chrono\>_](), with classes for date and time utilities.
