# Working with Date and Time in C++
Although C++ inherits [_\<ctime\>_](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/ctime/) from C, C++ provides its own library, [_\<chrono\>_](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/chrono/), with classes for date and time utilities. <br />
All classes from _\<chrono\>_ are a part of the namespace _std::chrono_; for sake of examples, I will only assume you are using namespace _std_.

The majority of this document has been constructed from the talk [_A \<chrono\> Tutorial_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P32hvk8b13M) by [Howard Hinnant](https://github.com/HowardHinnant), who is recognized as a master C++ programmer and invented move semantics.  All credit to him.

# Measuring Time

## _duration_
The _duration_ class is used to store a duration of time (the amount of time between two points in time); these points in time may or may not 
be _time\_point_ objects.

### _duration_ typedefs
There are a set of instantiations of the _duration_ class to represent common units for time like seconds, minutes, and hours. <br />
These instantiations can be used like any other datatype, so you can make _milliseconds_ the datatype for a function parameter and then 
pass '_10ms_' instead of '_10_' which is much clearer.

#### Initializing a _duration_
You cannot assign an integer to a _duration_ like `chrono::minutes time_waited = 3;` because '_3_' is an ambiguous amount. <br />
You have to write `chrono::minutes time_waited{3}` or `chrono::minutes time_waited = 3min` to indicate that you mean 3 minutes. <br />
From testing, it seems you cannot assign a smaller unit of time to a variable of a larger unit like `chrono::hours time = 3ms`.

#### Getting the Value of a _duration_
`cout << time_waited;` does not work. You have to access the amount of time by using the _.count()_ method. <br />
For example `cout << time_waited.count()` would work. However, adding two variables of type _seconds_ and assigning
it to a new _seconds_ variable is acceptable.

| Unit | Literal Suffix | Ratio |
| ---- | -------------- | ----- |
| [_chrono::hours_](https://www.cplusplus.com/hours) | h | 3600/1 |
| [_chrono::minutes_](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/chrono/minutes/) | min | 60/1 |
| [_chrono::seconds_](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/chrono/seconds/) | s | 1/1 |
| [_chrono::milliseconds_](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/chrono/milliseconds/) | ms | 1/1000 |
| [_chrono::microseconds_](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/chrono/microseconds/) | us | 1/1,000,000 |
| [_chrono::nanoseconds_](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/chrono/nanoseconds/) | ns | 1/1,000,000,000 |
> All the ratios use _seconds_ as the standard for comparison.
