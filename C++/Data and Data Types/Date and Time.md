# Working with Date and Time in C++
Although C++ inherits [_\<ctime\>_](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/ctime/) from C, C++ provides its own library, [_\<chrono\>_](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/chrono/), with classes for date and time utilities. <br />
All classes from _\<chrono\>_ are a part of the namespace _std::chrono_; for sake of examples, I will only assume you are using namespace _std_. <br />
Feel free to remove the _chrono::_ from everything you see if you are using the namespace _std::chrono_.

The majority of this document has been constructed from the talk [_A \<chrono\> Tutorial_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P32hvk8b13M) by [Howard Hinnant](https://github.com/HowardHinnant), who is recognized as a master C++ programmer and invented move semantics.  All credit to him.

# Basics of Keeping Time with the _duration_ and _time\_point_ Classes

# _duration_
The _duration_ class is used to store a duration of time (the amount of time between two points in time); these points in time may or may not 
be _time\_point_ objects.

## _duration_ typedefs
There are a set of instantiations of the _duration_ class to represent common units for time like seconds, minutes, and hours. <br />
These instantiations can be used like any other datatype, so you can make _milliseconds_ the datatype for a function parameter and then 
pass '_10ms_' instead of '_10_' which is much clearer.

| Unit | Literal Suffix | Ratio |
| ---- | -------------- | ----- |
| [_chrono::hours_](https://www.cplusplus.com/hours) | h | 3600/1 |
| [_chrono::minutes_](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/chrono/minutes/) | min | 60/1 |
| [_chrono::seconds_](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/chrono/seconds/) | s | 1/1 |
| [_chrono::milliseconds_](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/chrono/milliseconds/) | ms | 1/1000 |
| [_chrono::microseconds_](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/chrono/microseconds/) | us | 1/1,000,000 |
| [_chrono::nanoseconds_](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/chrono/nanoseconds/) | ns | 1/1,000,000,000 |
> All the ratios use _seconds_ as the standard for comparison.

## Initializing a _duration_
You cannot assign an integer to a _duration_ like `chrono::minutes time_waited = 3;` because '_3_' is an ambiguous amount. <br />
You have to write `chrono::minutes time_waited{3}` or `chrono::minutes time_waited = 3min` to indicate that you mean 3 minutes. <br />

## _duration\_cast\<T\>_
You can store a larger unit in a variable of a smaller unit (e.g. _hours_ in a variable of type _seconds_) without typecasting, but you cannot
store a smaller unit in a variable of a larger type unless you typecast as the larger datatype may [truncate](https://techterms.com/definition/truncate)
a portion of that data since it cannot be wholly represented. To 'type-cast' the time, use the [_duration\_cast\<T\>_](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono/duration/duration_cast) function.

For example, the line `chrono::hours h = 72min;` will not compile because 72 minutes cannot be represented in a whole hour (as 72 minutes is 1 hours and 12 minutes).
By typecasting, we force program to truncate the extra twelve minutes and store the 72 minutes as 1 hour: `chrono::hours h = chrono::duration_cast<chrono::hours>(72min);`.

## Getting the Value of a _duration_
`cout << time_waited;` does not work. You have to access the amount of time by using the _.count()_ method. <br />
For example `cout << time_waited.count()` would work. However, adding two variables of type _seconds_ and assigning
it to a new _seconds_ variable is acceptable.

## Mixed-mode Arithmetic
Doing math with variables of different units (e.g. _hours_ and _nanoseconds_) works just fine. <br />
The result will be returned in the smallest unit of the expression (in this case, nanoseconds).

## Creating Custom Durations
The _duration_ class is a template that can be used to create custom units of time. In the talk, Dr. Hinnant uses the example of a game developer trying to measure
60 frames a second, using the custom type '_frames_' as `using frames = duration<int32_t, ratio<1,60>>` such that a _frame_ is ~16.667 milliseconds.

# time_point

## Time Point Arithmetic 
You can subtract timepoints, but not add them.
