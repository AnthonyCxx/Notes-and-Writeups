# Structures in C++
Structures (colloquially called a 'struct') are a user-defined datatype that serve as a collection of variables. 
They are defined as a block of code prefaced with the [_struct_](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/struct-cpp?view=msvc-160) keyword and end with a semi-colon. 
Structs are just like classes in that they support not only data members, but also functions members -- they even support inheritance. This directly contrasts structs in C
in which structs can only have data members and must use function pointers to emulate methods.
