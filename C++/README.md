# A Reference for the C++ Programming Language
A reference for C++ programming. If you are using this for class, do not use anything past C++14. <br />
This is not meant to be an authority of any kind nor is it meant to be comprehensive.

Please read the [C++ Core Guidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md) for coding standards.

## Tricks and Tools
Tool: [_Online C++ Compiler_](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler) (good for quickly testing a piece of code) <br />
Tool: [_C++ Insights, source to source transformation_](https://cppinsights.io/) (shows you how the compiler changes your source code behind the scenes) <br />
Tool: [_cdecl, C gibberish to English_](https://cdecl.org/) (C -> English translator meant for C, but still sometimes useful) <br />
Tool: [_Hot Examples: Search C++ Code from 1,000,000+ Projects_](https://cpp.hotexamples.com/) <br />
Trick: [_The ''Clockwise/Spiral Rule''_](http://c-faq.com/decl/spiral.anderson.html) <br />
