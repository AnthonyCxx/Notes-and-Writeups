# A Reference for the C++ Programming Language
A reference for C++ programming. If you are using this for class, do not use anything past C++11.

I'm learning as I go and just using this as a form of documenting what I've learned. <br />
This is not meant to be an authority of any kind nor is it meant to be comprehensive.

P.S. If you don't know the difference between C and C++, [here](https://hackr.io/blog/difference-between-c-and-cplusplus) is a good article.

## Topics
Here are some shortcuts to the major folders and common files. <br />
This is **not** comprehensive, so be sure to explore them individual folders on your own. <br />
