# Storage Classes in C++


## _auto_

## _extern_

## _static_

## _mutable_

## _thread\_local_

## _register_
I've included _register_ last as, although it does exist, it was deprecitated in C++11 and was [removed in C++17 ](https://botondballo.wordpress.com/2015/06/05/trip-report-c-standards-meeting-in-lenexa-may-2015/). If you try to compile a program with the _register_ keyword in it with C++17, you will get a warning '_warning: ISO C++17 does not allow ‘register’
storage class specifier_'.
