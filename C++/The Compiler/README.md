# The C++ Compiler
For reference, I use the the G++ Compiler 9.3.0 on Ubuntu 20.04. Most of the stuff here is compiler-independent, but there are some things,
such as [pre-defined macros](https://stuff.mit.edu/afs/athena/project/rhel-doc/3/rhel-cpp-en-3/predefined-macros.html) and [GNU C++ extensions](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/C_002b_002b-Extensions.html) ([guide](https://www.keil.com/support/man/docs/armcc/armcc_chr1359124965274.htm)), which are compiler-specific and may not be accurate for your compiler.

A lot of the stuff in here can be done better with native C++ tools like _inline_ and _constexpr_, but still exist becasue C++ is a superset of C.
