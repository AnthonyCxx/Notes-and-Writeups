# Output in C++ with _cout_
_cout_, which stands for 'common output' (at least what I heard from college, I've also seen 'character output' and 'console output') belongs to the [\<iostream\>](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/iostream) 
library and is used to characters to [stdout](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/c/std_streams). _cout_ generally uses an [overloaded](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_overloading.htm) right bit-shift
operator (<<) to write to the screen (e.g. `cout << "Hello, World!\n"`), but also has other functions like [_cout.put()_](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_ostream/put) and [_cout.write()_](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_ostream/write).  In addition to general I/O functions, the [\<iomanip\>](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/iomanip) (I/O Manipulation) library provides methods like
[_setw()_](https://www.includehelp.com/cpp-tutorial/cpp-manipulators-endl-setw-setprecision-setf-cpp-programming-tutorial.aspx), [_setfill()_](https://www.includehelp.com/cpp-tutorial/cpp-manipulators-endl-setw-setprecision-setf-cpp-programming-tutorial.aspx) and [_setprecision()_](https://www.includehelp.com/cpp-tutorial/cpp-manipulators-endl-setw-setprecision-setf-cpp-programming-tutorial.aspx),
which can be used to format output with _cout_. 

Note: _cout_ is an object within the _std_ (standard) namespace. If you want to use it without `using namespace std;` at the top of your program, you'll have to write `std::cout`
instead of just `cout` every time you use it.

## Basic Usage with the << Operator
The << operator is overloaded such that it writes literals and expressions that evaluate to literals to the screen. <br />
An expression using `cout <<` returns _\*this_ (_cout_), so you can write `cout << "this " << "is " << "acceptable.\n";` and not have to write _cout_ every time. 
```C++
