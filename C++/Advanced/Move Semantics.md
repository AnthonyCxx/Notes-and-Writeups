# Move Semantics in C++
Move semantics are an optimization that reallocates the resources (contents) of a temporary object instead of copying it. <br />
Move semantics are especially efficient when dealing with large objects, and even more efficient if the transfer is marked [_noexcept_](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/exception-specifications-and-noexcept/).

## _lvalues_ and _rvalues_
Before you understand move semantics, you must first understand the difference between an _lvalue_ and an _rvalue_.
"Put simply, an lvalue is an object reference and an rvalue is a value." - Ray Lischner, [_C++ in a Nutshell_](https://www.amazon.com/C-Nutshell-Ray-Lischner/dp/059600298X).
For context, by 'object', he means an object (a value) stored in memory, not an instantiation of a class. An example of an _lvalue_ could be the string variable '_name_', 
whereas an _rvalue_ could be the integer literal '_10_'. Of course it may not always be this simple, a _rvalue_ could just as easily be the whole expression '_12 * 129 % pow(3, 92)_' or a string concatenation like '_"Weather: " + weather_', or even '_title + name_'.

### _lvalue_ and _rvalue_ References
You are likely familiar with _lvalue_ references, which use the [address-of operator](https://www.dummies.com/programming/cpp/how-address-operators-work-in-c/) (&).
We use _lvalue_ references for a number of things like passing and returning by reference (e.g. `void print(const string& str)`) or assigning a pointer to an existing 
variable (e.g. `int* ptr = &x`). Just like you can use _&_ to reference an _lvalue_, you can use _&&_ to reference an _rvalue_ (not to be confused with the 
[logical and operator](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_operators_logical.asp), which is also &&). To my knowledge, using _&&_ to indicate an _rvalue_ reference
is exclusively used when writing a function parameter, like <br /> `void print(string&& str)`, which would only take a string literal like '_Hello, World!_' and not a string 
variable like '_name_'.

You may not have run into the problem of not being able to pass a literal (an _rvalue_, like '_Hello_') into a function that takes a _const lvalue&_ 
(like `void print(const string& str)`) because _const_ _lvalues_ are interchangable with _rvalues_ in some situtations since both are non-modifiable data. 
If you re-wrote the function _print()_ to only take `string& str`, then passing '_Hello_' would cause an error.

You can remember the difference between _lvalues_ and _rvalues_ so: _lvalues_ have an _identifier_, a name that you can reference them with, like  string variable '_name_'; conversely, _rvalues_ are nameless. The number '_10_' does not have a name that you can call it with, and neither does the result
of the expression '_title + name_' â€” the result of the expression '_title + name_' is just a nameless, temporary string object.
The only exception to this rule is that an _lvalue_ is an _rvalue_ when used on the right-side of an assignment operation and is not modified in any way (e.g. `x = y`).

## Temporary Objects and Unnecessary Copying
Let's say you assign one string to another; what stops you from simply reallocating the resources of the string to the new string? Well, the old string still needs its
resources since it's its own variable. Reallocating the resources of the old string to the new string would steal them from the old string, which is a problem. But what if
we could guarantee that the old string wouldn't need its resources again? Say, if the string was a temporary string created as the result of an expression like '_title + name_'.
Copying in this case would be unnecessarily inefficient because the temporary string object as a result of '_title + name_' is going to go out of scope in a moment anyway.
You might as well just steal the resources from the temporary string since it's not going to do any harm.

This is the entire point of move semantics. Move semantics are an optimization that reallocates the resources (contents) of a temporary object instead of copying it.
Move semantics is especially efficient when dealing with large objects, and even more efficient if the transfer is marked
[_noexcept_](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/exception-specifications-and-noexcept/). Move semantics was impossible before C++11 because there was no way to 
differentiate between _lvalues_ and _rvalues_ syntactically. Now that we can explicitly refer to _rvalues_ with the _&&_ operator, we can do things like overload the
assignment operator (=) to steal the resources of an _rvalue_, allowing you to avoid copying where it is unnecessary.
