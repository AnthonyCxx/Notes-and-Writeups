# Varidic Functions in C++
A variadic function is a function varying [arity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arity) (the amount of arguments it can take). Variadic functions allow you to write a single 
function like _add()_ that can take any number of variables, literals, or combination of the two. I could call _add(1, 2)_ or _add(7, 14, 900)_ and it would work all the same.

## Variadic Templates (C++11)

## Fold Expressions (C++17)
C++17 added a cleaner, non-recursive way to write variadic functions: fold expressions.
