# Variadic Functions in C++
A variadic function is a function varying [arity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arity) (the amount of arguments it can take). Variadic functions allow you to write a single 
function like _add()_ that can take any number of variables, literals, or combination of the two. I could call _add(1, 2)_ or _add(7, 14, 900)_ and it would work all the same.

Though the implementation differs, all methods of creating variadic functions use an elipsis ('...', called the parameter pack) to represent the arguments passed
to the function as a list. Other languages also work the way way; C# uses the [_params_](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/c63ec5/use-params-keyword-in-C-Sharp/) keyword
to pass the list of arguments as an array and Python uses [_\*args_ and \*kwargs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/args-kwargs-python/) to pass the arguments as a list.

## Variadic Templates (C++11)
Variadic templates are templates that can instantiate functions of both varying types _and_ varying parameters. These functions are 'recursive' (but not really) because
they start with however many elements the give function has and perform the body of the function on each element one by one until they reach no elements, at which point 
the base case is called. A function _add(1, 2, 3)_ would run _add(1, 2, 3)_, then _add(2, 3)_, and then _add(3)_ (the base case, which just returns '_3_'). Interestingly
enough, variadic templates involve no actual recursion since the compiler creates the functions with the appropriate amount of arguments for each call, so it's only 
calling another function (even though it looks recursive). Because of this, variadic templates do not inherit the performance overhead that recursive functions have.

When the elipsis ('...') is placed on the left side of a type (`...Args`), it indicates that there is a parameter pack; when placed on the right side of a type (`args...`), 
it expands into the parameter pack. Use `...Args` to declare a parameter pack and `args...` to use one.

Like the typename '_T_', there is nothing special about the typename '_Args_' (which is short for 'arguments'), you can change it to anything â€” it's just the typename
of the parameter pack.

Example 1: a variadic _sum()_ function
```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

//Base case
template <typename T>
T sum(T&& num)
{
    return num;
}

//Variadic Template
template <typename T, typename ...Args>
T sum(T&& num, Args ...args)
{
    //Takes the first number and calls 'sum()' again, calling with 1 less item
    return num + sum(args...);
}

int main()
{
    cout << "1 + 2 = " << sum(1, 2) << '\n';

    cout << "7 + 14 + 900 = " << sum(7, 14, 900) << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

Example 2: a variadic _print()_ function
```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

//Base Case
template <typename T>
void print(T&& str)
{
    //Base case adds the final '\n'
    cout << str << '\n';
}

//Variadic Print Function
template <typename T, typename ...Args>
void print(T&& str, Args ...args)
{
    //Print a string
    cout << str << ' ';  //Add a space (to separate strings)

    //Print the rest of the strings...
    print(args...);   //Eventually reaches 'print(T)'
}

int main()
{
    print("This function", "will", "print", "any number of", "strings.");  //or anything else you give it, like '10'

    return 0;
}
```

## Fold Expressions (C++17)
C++17 added a cleaner, more straight-forward way to write variadic functions: fold expressions. Fold expressions allow you to write a single function that contains an
expression that is applied to the parameter pack. Once expanded, the expression will be applied to every member of the paramter pack. The only real drawback is that 
fold expressions tend to be simple, since they have such a specific form. If you need a more complex variadic function, use a variadic template.

The way a fold expression expands depends on the amount of operators (unary = 1, binary = 2) and the placement of the parameter pack (left or right); this means that there are 
four types of fold expressions: unary left, unary right, binary left, and binary right. Whether the fold is left or right doesn't matter for some operators (like `+`),
but does for others (like `-` and `/`).

### Unary Folds
Unary folds fold an expression over an operator (see [valid fold expression operators](https://docs.w3cub.com/cpp/language/fold)). An expression `... + args`
(a unary left fold, since the '...' is on the left) would expand to `((arg1 + arg2) + arg3) + arg4` whereas a unary right fold (`args && ...`) would expand towards the 
right `arg1 && (arg2 && (arg3 && arg4))`.

```C++
// C++17: COMPILE WITH 'g++ -std=c++17 file.cpp'  //
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

template <typename ...Args>     //'...' on the left for declarations
auto sum(Args&& ...args)
{
    //Unary left fold
    return (... + args);     //Expands to '(((num1 + num2) + num3) + num4) + num5'
}

int main()
{
    cout << "8 + 49 + 72 = " << sum(8, 49, 72, 3.14, 99999) << '\n';
    cout << "7.2 + 3513 = " << sum(7.2, 3513) << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

### Binary Folds
Not all expressions can be written with a unary fold because some expressions require more than just an operator, the parameter pack ('...'), and the arguments (args).
For example, if you wanted to write a variadic _print()_ function, you would need to preface the expression '_cout <<_', but you also can't have more than one operator
in a unary fold expression. Binary folds solve  this problem by allowsing you to preface/postface a fold with an value or expression (here, we preface it with `cout <<`.
To write a binary fold, preface a left fold with a value/expression and an operator (e.g. `base - ... - args` lets you subtract from a base with
any number of arguments) and postface a right fold with the same (e.g. `args - ... - base`). If the value prefixing/postfixing the binary fold is not in parentheses, 
the compiler will throw an error because it is not a single 'value'.

```C++
// C++17: COMPILE WITH 'g++ -std=c++17 file.cpp'  //
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

template <typename ...Args>
void println(Args&& ...args)
{
    //Binary fold expression
    (cout << ... << args) << '\n';
}

int main()
{
        println("this ", "prints " "fine: ", 3.14159265);
}
```

### Folding with Commas
Folding over a comma allows you to apply a function to each argument in a parameter pack. Any fold that contains a comma will be a right fold. Honestly,
I have no idea how this works.

```C++
// C++17: COMPILE WITH 'g++ -std=c++17 file.cpp'  //
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

//Returns a list of the squares of the given arguments
template <typename T, typename ...Args>
vector<T> squares(Args&& ...args)
{
    //Declare a vector of type 'T'
    vector<T> squares;

    //Fill the vector with the squares of the given numbers
    (squares.push_back(pow(args, 2)), ...);

    //Return the vector of squares
    return squares;
}

int main()
{
    //Print all the squares of the numbers 1-5
    for(auto square : squares<int>(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
    {
        cout << square << ' ';
    }
    cout << '\n';

    return 0;
}
```

### _sizeof...()_
The _sizeof...()_ operator returns how many arguments the fold expression accepted.

## C-Style Variadic Functions
C++ has access to C-style variadic functions through the [_\<cstdarg\>_](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdarg/) library. <br />
Honestly though, don't use it in C++; it's not type-safe and if you aren't careful, you'll get a segmentation fault.
