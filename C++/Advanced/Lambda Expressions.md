# Lambda Expressions in C++
A lambda expression is a [functor](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/functors-in-cpp/), a class with an overloaded _()_ operator such that it can be called like a function.
Lambda expressions are good for writing one-time functions that you don't want to dedicate an entire function to or for defining a function within another function. Lambda
expressions can be bound to a variable (usually of type [_auto_](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/type-inference-in-c-auto-and-decltype/)) or can be defined in a parameter being
passed to a function (hence why they're so good as one-time functions). Like functions, lambda expressions are composed of a parameter list, a return type, and a function
body; however, return types are optional for lambdas and they also have a [capture clause](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/lambda-captures/) that can give them access 
to variables within the same scope.

## Lambda Expression Format
```C++
[]() -> return_type {}

/*
[] : the capture clause
() : the parameter list
-> return_type : the return type of the function (optional)
{} : the body of the function
*/

//Example (notice the ';' at the end of the lambda)
auto isLowercase = [](char letter) -> bool { return letter >= 97 && letter <= 122; };

if (isLowercase('a'))  //Use the lambda like a function
    cout << "The letter 'a' is lowercase\n";
```
