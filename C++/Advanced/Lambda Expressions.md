# Lambda Expressions in C++
A lambda expression is a [functor](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/functors-in-cpp/), a class with an overloaded _()_ operator such that it can be called like a function.
Lambda expressions are good for writing one-time functions that you don't want to dedicate an entire function to or for defining a function within another function. Lambda
expressions can be bound to a variable (usually of type [_auto_](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/type-inference-in-c-auto-and-decltype/)) or can be defined in a parameter being
passed to a function (hence why they're so good as one-time functions).
