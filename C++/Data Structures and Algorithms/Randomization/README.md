# Randomization
"A randomized algorithm is an algorithm that employs a degree of randomness as part of its logic or procedure." <br />

## Randomizing Datasets
- [Fisher and Yates (Knuth) Randomization](https://github.com/EthanC2/Notes-and-Writeups/blob/main/C%2B%2B/Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms/Randomization/Fisher%20and%20Yates%20Randomizer.cpp) (standard simple)

## Random Selection
- `O(n)` Random Selection: [Uniform Random Number Generation](https://github.com/EthanC2/Notes-and-Writeups/blob/main/C%2B%2B/Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms/Randomization/Random%20Selection.cpp)
- Random Weighted Selection: [Alias Method](https://github.com/EthanC2/Notes-and-Writeups/blob/main/C++/Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms/Randomization/Alias%20Method.cpp), [Random Weighted Selection](https://github.com/EthanC2/Notes-and-Writeups/blob/main/C%2B%2B/Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms/Randomization/Random%20Weighted%20Selection.cpp)

## Random Number Generators
- [Linear Congruential Generator](https://github.com/EthanC2/Notes-and-Writeups/blob/main/C%2B%2B/Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms/Randomization/Linear%20Congruential%20Generator.cpp)
