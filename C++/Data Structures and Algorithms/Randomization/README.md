# Randomization
“Everything we care about lies somewhere in the middle, where pattern and randomness interlace.” <br />
James Gleick, The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood

## Randomizing (Shuffling) Datasets
- `O(n)` [Fisher and Yates (Knuth) Randomization](https://github.com/EthanC2/Notes-and-Writeups/blob/main/C%2B%2B/Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms/Randomization/Fisher%20and%20Yates%20Randomizer.cpp) (standard simple)

## Random Selection
-  `O(1)` Random Selection: [Uniform Random Number Generation](https://github.com/EthanC2/Notes-and-Writeups/blob/main/C%2B%2B/Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms/Randomization/Random%20Selection.cpp)
- `O(1)` Random Weighted Selection: [Alias Method](https://github.com/EthanC2/Notes-and-Writeups/blob/main/C++/Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms/Randomization/Alias%20Method.cpp) 
- `O(n)` Random Weighted Selection: [Uniform Weighted RNG](https://github.com/EthanC2/Notes-and-Writeups/blob/main/C%2B%2B/Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms/Randomization/Random%20Weighted%20Selection.cpp)

## Random Number Generators
- `DNU` [Linear Congruential Generator](https://github.com/EthanC2/Notes-and-Writeups/blob/main/C%2B%2B/Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms/Randomization/Linear%20Congruential%20Generator.cpp)
