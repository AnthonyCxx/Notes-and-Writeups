# Data Structures and Algorithms, using C++
A collection of implementations of data structures and algorithms, prefaced by their complexity. `DNU` means "**DO NOT USE**", marking something that exists only for you to explore or understand. For example, using a [linear congruential generator](https://github.com/EthanC2/Notes-and-Writeups/blob/main/C%2B%2B/Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms/Randomization/Linear%20Congruential%20Generator.cpp) (like `rand()`) is an objectively inferior choice when 
compared to C++'s implementation of the Mersenne Twister algorithm ([mt19937](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/random/mersenne_twister_engine)); even if you weren't 
to consider mt19937, `rand()` is infamous for being biased towards the lower end the distribution. Regardless of your use case, it should be marked `DNU`.
