# Exception Handling in C++
Exceptions are errors that occur during runtime, like a failure to allocate heap memory because the request was too large or there wasn't enough memory left ([_bad\_alloc_](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/new/bad_alloc/)); exceptions can be managed through a process called _exception handling_. Exception handling allows you to deal
with errors in a way that allows the program to continue running seamlessly (hopefully). Sometimes, an exception cannot be truly 'recovered' from, but can only be dealt with,
in which case exception handing allows a graceful solution to be achieved.
