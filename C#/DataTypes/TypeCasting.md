# Type Casting in C#
C# provides a class, [_System.Convert_](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.convert?view=net-5.0), that allows you to convert base datatypes (ints, doubles, chars) into each other via the class methods. I will not cover every datatype here, only the common ones. Reference [this Microsoft guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/types/) for all the methods.
