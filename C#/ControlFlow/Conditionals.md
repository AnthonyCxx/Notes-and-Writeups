# Conditional Statements in C#
Conditionals are 
```C#
if (condition)
{
    //Execute statements
}
```
> Note: If the condition is false, no code will be executed and the program will continue on.

## If 
The _if_ keyword is the heart of conditional statements - you cannot have a conditional statement without first have an _if_ statement. <br />

## Else

## Else if
