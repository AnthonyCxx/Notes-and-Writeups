# Conditional Statements in C#
Conditionals are control structures that allow you to control the flow of a program based on certain (boolean) criteria. <br />
If the condition is true, then the statments within the _{ }_ will be executed; otherwise, no code will be executed and the program will continue on.

### Format
```C#
if (condition)   //If the condition is true, then
{
    //Execute statements
}
```
### Example
```C#
bool isBook = true;

if (isBook)   //'isBook' is replaced by its value (true)
{
    //Statements to be executed
    System.Console.WriteLine("The item is a book!");
}

```
> This snippet prints "The item is a book!"

## If 
The _if_ keyword is the heart of conditional statements - you cannot have a conditional statement without first have an _if_ statement. <br />

## Else

## Else if
