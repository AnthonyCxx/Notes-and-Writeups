# Iteration Statements (Loops) in C#
Loops (iteration statements) allow you to repeat a statement or block of statements multiple times, usually until some condition is no longer true.
C# has 4 types of iteration statements: for statements, foreach statements, do statements, and while statements. Loops consist of a condition and a body <br />

## For Statements
The _for_ statement allows you to execute a block of statements a specific number of times. <br />
A _for_ statement consists of a declaration statement, a condition, and an update statemnt in that order; each of these sections are separated by semi-colons. <br />
