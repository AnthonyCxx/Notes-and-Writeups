# Variables in C#

## Naming Variables after Keywords
Keywords are reserved, and a variable cannot have the same name as a keyword by default; <br />
however, it is possible to name a variable after a keyword if you prepend a _@_ in the variable declaration.
```#C
string @event = "Displaying Main Menu";
```
> Note: _event_ is keyword used to "declare an event in a publisher class"
