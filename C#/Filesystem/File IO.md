# Working with Files in C#
In C#, files are viewed as [streams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.stream?view=net-6.0). C# provides three types of stream reader/writers:

| Stream Class | Function |
| ------------ | -------- | 
| StreamReader / StreamWriter | reading/writing data as text (ASCII, Unicode) |
| BinaryReader / BinaryWriter | reading/writing data as bytes; used in [serialization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/serialization/) |
| XMLReader / XMLWriter | reading/writing [XML](https://cdrh.unl.edu/articles/basicguide/XML) data |
