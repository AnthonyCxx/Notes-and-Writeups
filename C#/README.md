# Reference Notes for C#
The majority of the information here comes straight from the [.NET Microsoft Official Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system?view=net-5.0). <br />
All I've done is synthesize it and provide some code snippets to make an easy reference for myself and others. <br />

I fill the notes out as a I learn concepts and am not completely filling them out section by section. <br /> 
Naturally, these notes are in no way comprehensive.
