# Operator Overloading in C#
Since classes are user-defined types, built-in operators like `+` are not implicitly defined since the program does not know how `Person1 + Person2` should do. Because of this,
you have to explicitly define how operators should work with classes using operator overloading. In C#, operator overloads are defined as `public static` methods.
