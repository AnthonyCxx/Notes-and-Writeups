# Classes and Object-Oriented Programming in C#
Object-oriented programming is a [programming paradigm](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/paradigms/) in which concepts (abstract or concrete) are represented as user-defined
datatypes. These custom types, called classes, contain both the state and actions related to the concept being represented. For example, a class "Dog" would be designed 
to model a dog (perhaps in the context of a video game or a similar program). The dog class would contain collection of variables describing the dog (strings for its
name and breed, and maybe an int for its age) as [functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/methods) (aka methods) for performing actions (like barking or wagging its tail). At the end of the day, classes are just a means of organizing data to promote well-structured programs.
