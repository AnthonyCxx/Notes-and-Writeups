# Interfaces in C#
"An interface is a type definition similar to a class, except that it purely represents a contract between an object and its user. \[An interface\] cannot be directly instantiatied as an object, nor can its data members be defined. So, an interface is nothing but a collection of method and property declarations. "

### Conventions
- Identifiers should have a prepended _I_
