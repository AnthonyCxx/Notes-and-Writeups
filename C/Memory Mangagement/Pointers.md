# Pointers in C
A pointer is a variable that points to some location in memory in order to keep track of [dynamically-allocated memory](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/c-dynamic-memory-allocation). Like any variable, pointers are [strongly-typed](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs1130/2012sp/1130selfpaced/module1/module1part4/strongtyping.html); however, they can also be [type-casted](https://ecomputernotes.com/what-is-c/function-a-pointer/type-casting-of-pointers) easily.
