# Pointers in C
A pointer is a variable that points to some location in memory in order to keep track of [dynamically-allocated memory](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/c-dynamic-memory-allocation). Like any variable, pointers are [strongly-typed](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs1130/2012sp/1130selfpaced/module1/module1part4/strongtyping.html); however, they can also be [type-casted](https://ecomputernotes.com/what-is-c/function-a-pointer/type-casting-of-pointers) easily.

## Declaring a Pointer
Pointers are declared like a normal variable, but include a '\*' after the datatype. If not given a value, 
```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void)
{
    int* ptr;     // 'ptr' is short for 'pointer'

    return 0;
}
```

## The & Operator

```C

```

## Dereferencing (accessing) Pointers

```C

```
