# Dynamic Memory Allocation in C
Typically, when you declare a variable (an array, let's say) you know in advance how big it will need to be; however, this is not always the case.
The need to store data that we do not already know the size of gave rise to the need for [dynamic memory allocation](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/c-dynamic-memory-allocation), the ability to declare variables (and even data structures) at runtime. Dynamic memory is stored in [the heap](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-layout-of-c-program/) as opposed to the stack (ref. [_The Stack vs the Heap_](https://nickolasteixeira.medium.com/stack-vs-heap-whats-the-difference-and-why-should-i-care-5abc78da1a88).
