# The C Compiler
For reference, I use the the GCC Compiler 9.3.0 on Ubuntu 20.04. Most of the stuff here is compiler-independent, but there are some things, such as 
[pre-defined macros](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Common-Predefined-Macros.html#Common-Predefined-Macros) and [GNU C extensions](https://github.com/EthanC2/Notes-and-Writeups/blob/main/C/The%20Compiler/GNU%20C%20Extensions.md), which are compiler-specific and may not be accurate for your compiler.
