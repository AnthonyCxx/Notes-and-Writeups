 # A Reference for the C Programming Language
 
Here are some notes I took to prepare for CSC-2410. If you don't understand something, ask me or use [this C gibberish translator](https://cdecl.org/). <br />
Alternatively, here is a really solid [quick reference sheet](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~adnan/c-refcard.pdf) from the University of Texas at Austin.
 
I used a lot of different resources for each topic, but if I had to pick a book, it'd be [_Learn C Programming_](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/learn-c-programming-jeff-szuhay/1137258930) 
by Jeff Szuhay; <br /> it's a great book and anyone who knows C++ will be able to just speed through the book.
