 # A Reference for the C Programming Language
 
 Here are some notes I took to prepare for CSC-2410. If you don't understand something, ask me or use [this C gibberish translator](https://cdecl.org/) <br />
 
 I used a lot of different resources for each topic, but if I had to pick a book, it'd be [_Learn C Programming_](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/learn-c-programming-jeff-szuhay/1137258930) 
 by Jeff Szuhay; <br /> it's a great book and anyone who knows C++ will be able to just speed through the book.
