# Functions in Python
A function is a block of code that can be invoked by name. <br />
Functions allow you to break up your code into sections, achieving [modular programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming). <br />
If you don't care about that, then you might like that it lets you write code once and then use it as many times as you want where you want.

## Defining a Function
A function definition begins with the [_def_](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions) keyword followed by the name of the function,
and parameter list (parentheses) and a colon to start the block. After that, anything within the block is a part of the function.
