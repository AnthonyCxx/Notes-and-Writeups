# Functions in Python
A function is a block of code that can be invoked by name. <br />
Functions allow you to break up your code into sections, achieving [modular programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming). <br />
If you don't care about that, then you might like that it lets you write code once and then use it as many times as you want where you want.
