## Arithmetic
| Operator | Arity | Function |
| -------- | ----- | -------- |
| + | Binary | Addition |
| - | Binary | Subtraction |
| * | Binary | Multiplication |
| / | Binary | Division |
| % | Binary | Modulus |
| // | Binary | [Floor Division](https://python-reference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/operators/floor_division.html) |
| ** | Binary | Exponent |

## Comparison
| Operator | Arity | Function |
| -------- | ----- | -------- |
| == | Binary | Equality |
| != | Binary | Inequality |
| < | Binary | Less than |
| <= | Binary | Less than or equal to |
| > | Binary | Greater than |
| >= | Binary | Greater than or equal to |

## Logical
| Operator | Arity | Function |
| -------- | ----- | -------- |
| and | Binary | True if both operands are true |
| or | Binary | True if one operand is true |
| not | Unary | True if the operand is false |

## Identity
| Operator | Arity | Function |
| -------- | ----- | -------- |
| is | Binary | True if the second class is or is derived from the first |
| is not | Binary | True if the second class is not or is not derived from the first |

## Membership
| Operator | Arity | Function |
| -------- | ----- | -------- |
| in | Binary | True if the first item is found in the sequence (the second) |
| not in | Binary | False if the first item is found in the sequence (the second) |

## Bitwise
| Operator | Arity | Function |
| -------- | ----- | -------- |
| & | Binary | Bitwise AND |
| \| | Binary | Bitwise OR |
| ^ | Binary | Bitwise XOR |
| ~ | Unary | One's Complement |
| << | Binary | Left Bit-shift |
| >> | Binary | Right Bit-shift |
