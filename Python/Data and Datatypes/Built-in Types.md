# Built-in Types in Python

## Boolean Type, _bool_
Booleans can either be _True_ or _False_ (mind the capital letter) and are used in control flow statements and loops (_if_, _while_, etc.). 
Most datatypes are [implicitly boolean](http://anh.cs.luc.edu/handsonPythonTutorial/boolean.html) are can be used as bools. 
All numeric types are false when 0 and true otherwise, containers are false when empty (strings, lists, sets, etc.), and _None_ is always false.

### Operators
Booleans have three operators associated with them: _and_, _or_ and _not_ (see [logical operators](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp)). <br />
These operators can be used to modify and/or chain conditionals like `if condition1 and not condition2:`.

## Text Sequence Type, _str_


## _None_
The [_None_](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_keyword_none.asp) type is the Python equivalent of [NULL](https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-null-958118#:~:text=Null%20is%20a%20built%2Din,pattern%20for%20a%20null%20pointer.)
