# Binary Sequence Types in Python
The [_bytes_](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/bytes), [_bytearray_](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/bytearray), and [_memoryview_](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memoryview-in-python/) are datatypes oriented towards manipulating binary data. _bytes_ and _bytearray_ store binary data; 
_memoryview_ is used to access the data without needing to create a copy.
