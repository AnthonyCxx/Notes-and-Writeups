# String Methods in Python

## Modifying Strings

## Formatting Strings

### _.capitalize()_
Returns a new string, capitalizing the first letter in the string.

```Python
sentence = "this is not a proper sentence because the first letter is not capitalized."
sentence = sentence.capitalize()
```

### _.casefold()_
_.casefold()_ returns a new string that is entirely lowercase. <br />
Unlike _.lower()_, _.casefold()_ works with unicode capitals.

```Python
urname = "Wei√üflog"
surname = surname.casefold() # Changed to 'weissflog'
```
