# GUI Development with Python and PyQt5
[Qt](https://www.qt.io/) is a C++ library for GUI development that works on any platform. [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) allows you to write these GUIs with native
Python code.

Yes, I am aware that PyQt6 was released several months ago, but PyQt5 has been around for so long that there are many good resources for learning it.
