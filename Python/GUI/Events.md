# Event-driven Programming (Slots and Signals)
GUIs are fundamentally built on a paradigm of programming called [event-driven programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming), which make GUIs interactive. Event-driven programming is composed of _events_ and _event handlers_ such that whenever the user performs specific actions (like clicking a button), it triggers a [callback function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_(computer_programming)) that performs some sort of action (like submitting an answer).
