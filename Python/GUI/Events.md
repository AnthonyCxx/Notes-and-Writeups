# Event-driven Programming (Signals and Slots)
GUIs are fundamentally built on a paradigm of programming called [event-driven programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming), which make GUIs interactive. Event-driven programming is composed of _events_ and _event handlers_ such that whenever the user performs specific actions (like clicking a button), it triggers a [callback function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_(computer_programming)) that performs some sort of action (like submitting an answer). 

In Qt, [Widgets](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/pyqt-basic-widgets/) like send out _signals_.

Here's a good article on signals and slots: PythonGUIs: [Signals, Slots & Events](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/pyqt-signals-slots-events/).
