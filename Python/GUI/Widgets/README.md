# Widgets in PyQt5
"Widgets are basic building blocks of an application. PyQt5 has a wide range of various widgets, including buttons, check boxes, sliders, or list boxes." ([Zetcode](https://zetcode.com/gui/pyqt5/widgets/)). There are _many_ widgets in Qt (a full list can be found [here](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwidgets-module.html#details)), only the most
essential of which I'll be covering here.

## Widgets
| Widget | Function |

| [QCheckbox](https://github.com/EthanC2/Notes-and-Writeups/blob/main/Python/GUI/Widgets/QCheckbox.md) | a togglable option button |
