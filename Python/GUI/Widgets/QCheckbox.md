# QCheckbox in PyQt5
"A QCheckBox is an option button that can be switched on (checked) or off (unchecked). Checkboxes are typically used to represent features in an application that
can be enabled or disabled without affecting others. Different types of behavior can be implemented. For example, a QButtonGroup can be used to group check buttons logically, 
allowing exclusive checkboxes. However, QButtonGroup does not provide any visual representation." - [Qt Documentation](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qcheckbox.html)
