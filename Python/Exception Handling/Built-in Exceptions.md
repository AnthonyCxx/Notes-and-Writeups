# Built-in Exception in Python
Here are some common exceptions that are built into Python.

Don't expect this to be comprehensive, because it isn't. Reference Python's documentation, [_Built-in Exceptions_](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#built-in-exceptions), for a master reference.

## Exception
_Exception_ is the parent exception of all exceptions. Catching _Exception_ will catch any and all errors.

```Python
try:
    num = 0 / 0
except Exception:
    print("Caught an error")
```

## ValueError

```Python

```

## 

```Python
