# Loops in Python

## _for_ Loops
In Python, for loops work a bit differently. If you wrote `for num in [1, 2, 3]` then _num_ would actually take on the values of 1, 2, and 3 while it iterated over the list.
This is what makes Python's for-loops distinct â€” the fact that they take on the value of element at the index in an object (1, 2, 3) instead of the value of the index itself (0, 1, 2)

Iterating over a collection like a list or a tuple
```Python
items = ["A Backpack", "A Map", "A Sword", "Boots (the monkey)", "A leopard-print bookshelf (ew)"]

# Loop over the items, where 'item' is the current item
for item in items:
    print(item)
```

Iterating over a string is done just like a list since it's also a sequence.
```Python
word = "Arrow"

for char in word:  # For every character in the word
    print(char)    # Print the current character
```

## Traditional For-loops with _range()_
The _range()_ function returns a list of integers that can be iterated over and is used for traditional for-loops. <br />
Optionally, you can provide a range of numbers and even a step if needed.

**NOTE**: _range()_ stops BEFORE the end number and does not count it. You have to add 1 to include the end number.
```Python
# Traditional For-loop
for num in range(10):  # 0-9
    print(num)
    
# Loop Starting at Non-Zero Number
for num in range(50, 61): # 50-60
    print(num)

# Looping with a Step
for num in range(10, 21, 2): # 10-20, counting by 2s
    print(num)
```

## _while_ Loops
Unlike a _for_-loop, which always has a set, known amount of iterations, a _while_ loop is meant to be used when the amount of iterations is unknown and should be based
on a condition instead.
