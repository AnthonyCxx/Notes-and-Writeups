Conditionals in Python
Conditionals are control structures that allow you to control the flow of a program based on certain ([boolean](https://realpython.com/python-boolean/)) criteria. <br />

## _if_, _else_, and _elif_

## The 'Ternary Operator', \_\_ if \_\_ else \_\_

```Python

```

## Pattern Matching
Until Python 3.10, Python lacked [structural pattern matching](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0636/), which is their take on the classic _switch_ statement. <br />
It's doubtful that you're working in Python 3.10, so you'll probably just have to use _if_-_else_ chains instead.
