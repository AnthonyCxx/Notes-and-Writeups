# Lambda Expression in Python
Lambda is a one-time function that are often used so you don't have to define a whole function for a one-time use of something like the [_filter()_](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/filter-in-python/) function. Lambdas as composed of two sections: the lambda declaration and parameters (everything before the colon) and the 
body (everything after the colon). A simple lambda expression that squares and returns a number given to it would look like `lambda x: x**2`.
