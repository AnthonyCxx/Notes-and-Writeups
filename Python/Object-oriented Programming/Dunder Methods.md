# Dunder Methods in Python
Dunder methods (_dunder_ == 'double underscore') are special methods that can be used to enhance your classes. Dunder methods are prefix and postfixed by two underscores
and their functionality covers everything from constructors to operator overloading.

## Creation, Initialization and Destruction
The following methods are run automatically when an object is created or destroyed.
