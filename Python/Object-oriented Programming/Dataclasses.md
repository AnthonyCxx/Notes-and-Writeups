# Dataclasses in Python
Dataclasses are a special type of class that are tailored for storing data. Dataclasses are imported from the [_dataclasses_](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html)
module as _dataclass_, which contains a decorator, `@dataclass`, that can be used to make a class a dataclass. Dataclasses can be especially convenient because they automatically 
generate a host of magic methods: \_\_init_\_\, \_\_repr_\_\, \_\_eq\_\_, all the comparison operators (\_\_lt\_\_, \_\_le\_\_, \_\_gt\_\_, \_\_ge\_\_), and possibly even
\_\_hash\_\_.
