# Static and Class Methods in Python
Think of static and class methods like class attributes: they are a member of a class but not bound to any particular instance of said class. <br />
Static and class methods are denoted by the `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` [decorators](https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/#simple-decorators) respectively.
