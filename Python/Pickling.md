# Pickling in Python
Picking is a form of [data persistance](https://c3.ai/glossary/features/data-persistence/) that works by storing a [serialized](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-why-and-how-of-de-serialization-in-python-2d4c3b622f6b) version of data so it can be stored in a file and used later. Unlike formats like CSV and XML, pickling is specific to Python.

A wide array of data in Python can be pickled, see the Python Documentation, [_What can be pickled and unpickled?_](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#what-can-be-pickled-and-unpickled) for a full list.
