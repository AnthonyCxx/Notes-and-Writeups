# Coreutils, the Basics of Linux
_Coreutils_ is indisputably the most important package in all of Linux. "The GNU Core Utilities are the basic file, shell and text manipulation utilities of 
the GNU operating system. These are the core utilities which are expected to exist on every operating system."
> Source: [_GNU, Coreutils_](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/) <br />
> You may find it strange that it calls Linux "the GNU operating system", but Linux is really only a [kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)). The actual operating system is entirely made by [The GNU Foundation](https://www.gnu.org/doc/doc.html). Rightly, they call Linux "GNU/Linux" instead of just Linux.
