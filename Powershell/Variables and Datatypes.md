# Variables and Datatypes in Powershell
Variables are flexible storage locations for data that can be invoked by name. Powershell is a [strong, dynamically-typed](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/04/introduction-to-programming-type-systems/) language, which means that although variables do have a datatype, the type can change dynamically.
