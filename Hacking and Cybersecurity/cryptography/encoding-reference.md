## What is encoding?
"Encoding is the process of putting a sequence of characters such as letters, numbers and other special characters into a specialized format for efficient transmission. <br />

Decoding is the process of converting an encoded format back into the original sequence of characters. It is completely different from Encryption which we usually misinterpret. <br />

Encoding and decoding are used in data communications and storage. Encoding should NOT be used for transporting sensitive information." <br />
\- an excerpt from [TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/security_testing/encoding_and_decoding.htm#:~:text=Encoding%20is%20the%20process%20of,the%20original%20sequence%20of%20characters.)

**Note: be aware that there are variations of nearly every encoding scheme. If you're not getting results, look into similar schemes.** <br />
For example, if you are not getting results from something that looks like base64, try base58 or base85.

## Binary
Binary is a base-2 number system. Binary (the number system) is distinct from binary (machine) code; however, the binary number system does underlie binary code.
Binary is used for computer systems as it is a reliable (less error-prone) way of evaluating the state of an electrical signal.

## Octal
Octal is a base-8 number system consisting of the numbers 0-7. It only need 3 bits to represent a number, so octal is often used when the amount of bits is evenly divisible by
3. The octal system uses less digits than both decimal and hex, and so is both safer and more efficient. Nevertheless, it is less popular.

## Hexadecimal
Hexadecimal is a base-16 number system consisting of the numbers 0-9 and character A-F (case is irrelevant). Characters were used for the final 6 members because they are distrinct from numbers. Hexadecimal is often used as a compact method of representing binary data where each character represents 4 bits (this way, every 2 hex digits is one byte). <br />

## Base64
Base64 is an encoding scheme that transforms (mostly) alphanumeric strings, translating three (3) characters at a time. Because of its small value table, Base64 is quite limited; regardless, it is sufficient for simple encoding. The Base64 table includes letters, numbers, and the symbols '+' and '/'; you will also see '=' for padding, but only for last or last two characters when needed to make the amount of characters a multiple of three.   <br />

A key identifier that a string could be encoded with Base64 is that the amount of characters is a multiple of three â€” this is especially the likely if the last or last two characters are '='. <br />

In standard practice, you will only see strings encoded with Base64 with characters from the Base64 table; however, in competitions such as CTFs, you may see impure strings that are encoded in Base64. To decode these strings, you will need to utilize the `-i` flag to ignore garbage (irrelevant characters), such as symbols.
