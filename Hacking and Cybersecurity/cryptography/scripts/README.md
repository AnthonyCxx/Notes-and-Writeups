## Description
This folder contains various scripts for decrypting/deciphering messages. <br />
Just copy and paste the code into an online interpreter to get started. <br />

- Python/C/C++/Java Environment: [link](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/)
- C# Environment: [link](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_csharp_online.php)
- Bash Environment: [link](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_bash_online.php)

## Raison d'Ãªtre
I know most if not all of these exist online already, but these scripts are tailored to the NCL. <br />
Furthermore, these scripts allow you to study the implementation of the ciphers.

## Rules
All scripts should be limited to native modules so they can be used in online interpreters.
