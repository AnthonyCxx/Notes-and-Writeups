## What is WHOIS?
When an individual or company registers a [domain name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name), they must provide identifying information. 
This information could be things such as their [name, address, email, phone number, or administrative/technical contacts](https://whois.icann.org/en/about-whois). 
This infromation is updated annually. And, in case you didn't catch on by now, 'whois' is really just 'who is'...
