## Directory Setup
| Folder | Explanation | 
| ------ | ----------- |
| [understanding-awk.md](https://github.com/hpu-panthersec/cyber-comp-materials/blob/main/log-analysis/AWK/understanding-awk.md) | a summary of the programming language AWK |
| [awk-predefined-variable.md](https://github.com/hpu-panthersec/cyber-comp-materials/blob/main/log-analysis/AWK/awk-predefined-variables.md) | useful, pre-defeined variables |
[awk-snippets.md](https://github.com/hpu-panthersec/cyber-comp-materials/blob/main/log-analysis/AWK/awk-snippets.md) | useful AWK snippets |
| [awk-script-format.md](https://github.com/hpu-panthersec/cyber-comp-materials/blob/main/log-analysis/AWK/awk-script-format.md) | the general format of an AWK script for reference |

## Purpose
I don't intend for this to be a comprehensive guide to AWK, but it does cover just about everything but AWK's [Built-in Functions](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/awk/awk_built_in_functions.htm). <br /> Regardless, this guide should give you at least a functional grasp of AWK.

## Resources
I highly reccomend the book _Learn AWK Programming_ by Shiwang Kalkhanda, he did a really good job with it and most of the content here has been derived from his book
and _Effective AWK Programing, 4th Edition_ by Arnold Robbins. _Effective AWK Programming_ does assume that you already know AWK, so start with _Learn AWK Programming_.
Both books are available on the O'Rielly Learning Platform through the Association of Computer Machinery.
