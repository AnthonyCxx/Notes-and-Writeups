## Standardized Files
| File Name | Purpose |
| --------- | ------- |
| README.md | provides a reference for the purpose of each file in the folder |
| tools.md     | lists the tools used in a branch of cybersecurity | 
| cheat-sheet.md | provides a shallow reference for all the information on a topic | 

## Standardized Folders
| Folder Name | Purpose |
| --------- | ------- |
| learning-resources | a subdirectory geared towards teaching the field instead of providing references | 
| practice-resources | a subdirectory of LearningResources that contains websites and materials for practicing one's skills |


# Philosophy
- The structure of this repository should be such that every file or folder has a single purpose.
- Everything should be documented such that it could be understood even when abstracted from this repo.
- All files should be structured such that they work on the commandline just as well as they work online and vice versa.

# Standards/Conventions

## Expository Files
- Every folder must contain a README.md file (or a file of similar purpose) containing an explanation of the contents of that folder. <br />
- Every aspect of this repository should be so thoroughly explained that no one could possibly be confused.
- Always cite your sources appropriately, including the name of the website and a link to it using both the raw link and Markdown's \[]() hyperlinking structure.

## File Naming Scheme
- Folder and file names must _NOT_ contain spaces to allow ease of terminal use.
- Use hyphens to separate words (Ex. cyber-comp-materials)

## File Formats
| File Type | Format | Extention |
| --------- | ------ | --------- |
| Text File | [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) | .md |

## File Structure
- Files such as indices should keep consistent formatting accross all lines, that means using delimiters to separate file content and hyphens to indicate that some item is missing/not applicable.
