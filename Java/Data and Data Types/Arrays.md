# Arrays in Java
Arrays are a data structure that store a collection of elements of the same type; these elements can be primitive types like ints or they can be objects.
Arrays have a fixed size which is set when the array is declared. To access the individual elements, you must know the index; otherwise, you have to iterate over 
the array manually.
