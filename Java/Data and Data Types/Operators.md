'=' = assignment operator

| Operator | Type | Function |
| -------- | ---- | -------- |
| + | addition |
| - | subtraction |
| * | multiplication |
| / | division |
| % | [modulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic) |

## Unary Operators
Unary operators are operators that take only one operand

| Operator | Type | Function |
| -------- | ---- | -------- |
| ! |  |
| ++ |  |
| -- |  |
| ++ |  |
| -- |  |

## Logical Operators

| < | less than|
| > | greater than |
| <= | less than or equal to |
| >= | greater than or equal to |

### Conditional Operators
| Operator | Type | Function |
| -------- | ---- | -------- |
| && | binary | logical and |
| \|\| | binary | logical or |
| ? : | ternary | [ternary operator](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-ternary-operator-with-examples/) |

## Bitwise Operators
| Operator | Type | Function |
| -------- | ---- | -------- |

| & | binary | [bitwise and](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/bitwise-operators#and) |
| \| | binary | [bitwise or](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/bitwise-operators#or) |
| ^ | binary | [xor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or) (exclusive or) |
| >> | binary | [left bit-shift](https://www.interviewcake.com/concept/java/bit-shift) |
| << | binary | [right bit-shift](https://www.interviewcake.com/concept/java/bit-shift) |
| >>> | binary | [unsigned right bit-shift](https://www.javatpoint.com/unsigned-right-shift-operator-in-java) |
