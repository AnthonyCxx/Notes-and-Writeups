# OverTheWire-WriteUps
This repository contains write-ups on various OverTheWire levels. Once I finish the Bandit exercises, I will begin working on Krypton or Semtex.

## Project Description

## Most Recent Update
Write-up 12 has been completed. Write-up 13 is in progress.

## What is Bandit/OverTheWire?
If you are not familiar with OverTheWire, OverTheWire is a community of people who offer cybersecurity puzzles/challenges with the intent of helping people learn 
cybersecurity/ethical hacking. The _Bandit_ challenges are a set of those challenges designed to teach proficiency in Linux. There are a total of 35 Bandit exercises.
