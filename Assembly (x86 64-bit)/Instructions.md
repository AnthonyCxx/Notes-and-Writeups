# Instructions in x86 Assembly
Instructions, also called [_opcodes_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/operation-code) (operation codes), are the instructions that the CPU understands.
The registers contain the data and the opcodes perform the manipulations on said data. When you need to do something that the CPU itself can't (like printing to the screen),
you have to make a [system call](https://www.cs.uaf.edu/2017/fall/cs301/lecture/11_17_syscall.html).

This is a reference for instructions, but is not comprehensive because [there are _so_ many opcodes](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/).
