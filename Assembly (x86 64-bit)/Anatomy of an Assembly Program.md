# Anatomy of an Assembly Program
An assembly source file (.asm) has three major sections: _.data_, _.bss_, and _.text_. Both the _.data_ and _.bss_ sections store data, while _.text_ contains the source code.

## .data
where all data is defined before compilation (known values)

## .bss
where all data is allocated for future use (unknown values)

## .text
where the code will go
